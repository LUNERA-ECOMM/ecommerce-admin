I'm building a Next.js 16 e-commerce app with Firebase Authentication. I need step-by-step instructions to set up Google Sign-In.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Next.js 16 with App Router (React 19)
- Firebase project ID: ecommerce-2f366
- Firebase Hosting already configured (region: europe-west1)
- Need Google Authentication for admin access

WHAT I'VE BUILT:
- E-commerce homepage at root (/)
- Admin dashboard at /admin/overview (protected route)
- Admin email: arbengrepi@gmail.com
- Using Firebase SDK v12.5.0 with signInWithPopup and GoogleAuthProvider

MY FIREBASE CONFIG CODE NEEDS THESE ENV VARIABLES:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID (I know this: ecommerce-2f366)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. EXACT STEPS to enable Google Authentication in Firebase Console:
   - Navigation path (e.g., "Go to Authentication → Sign-in method → Google")
   - What settings to enable/configure
   - Any OAuth consent screen setup needed in Google Cloud Console

2. WHERE TO FIND each Firebase config value:
   - Exact location in Firebase Console (Project Settings → General → Your apps?)
   - Screenshot descriptions or detailed navigation steps
   - Which app type (Web app) to create/use

3. COMPLETE .env.local EXAMPLE:
   - Show the exact format with placeholder values
   - Which values come from where

4. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP:
   - Do I need to add localhost to authorized domains?
   - Any CORS or domain restrictions?

5. SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES:
   - Any Firebase Security Rules needed?
   - How to protect admin routes properly?

6. VERIFICATION STEPS:
   - How to test the setup works
   - Common issues and fixes

Please provide detailed, step-by-step instructions with exact navigation paths in Firebase Console. I'm new to Firebase Authentication setup, so be thorough!
